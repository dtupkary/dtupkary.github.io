Below is a brief summary of my main research areas.

# Quantum Key Distribution
I am broadly interested in all aspects of Quantum Key Distribution, and of Quantum Information Theory. 

Recently, I have been interested in improving the analysis of the *classical* part of QKD protocols, such as information leakage during error-correction.
My master's thesis involved improving the performance for QKD protocols by inventing improved ways of processing *classical* data in QKD protocols. This is particularly useful, since compared to hardware changes, such modifications can be implemented very easily.

# Open Quantum Systems
There are a myriad number of ways to study the dynamics of systems weakly connected to baths. A common approach is to use a quantum master equation (QME) for the setup we are interested in studying, which typically requires various approximations to derive. Depending on the choice of approxmiations, a variety of quantum master equations can be obtained.

I am interested in studying the validity of various QMEs, *independent* of specific system-bath setups. What kind of master equations can predict thermalization correctly? or transport properties? or preserve complete positity?. What conditions do such requirements impose on the QMEs themselves? How can we derive such QMEs ?

My recent work lays down fundamental requirements on QMEs that must be satisfied in order to avoid physical inconsistencies.
