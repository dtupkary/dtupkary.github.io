I am Devashish, currently a graduate student in Physics at the [Institute for Quantum Computing](https://uwaterloo.ca/institute-for-quantum-computing/), Canada. At IQC, I am primarily working on various aspects of Quantum Key Distribution, advised by [Norbert Lutkenhaus](https://uwaterloo.ca/physics-astronomy/people-profiles/norbert-lutkenhaus). I am also interested in various aspects of open quantum systems, and broadly, quantum information theory.

Previously, I got my BS(Research) degree from the [Indian Institute of Science](https://iisc.ac.in/), Bengaluru in 2020.
