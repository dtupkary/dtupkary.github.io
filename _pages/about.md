I am a graduate student at the [Institute for Quantum Computing](https://uwaterloo.ca/institute-for-quantum-computing/), Canada, where I am funded by the Mike and Ophelia Laziridis Fellowship. At IQC, I am  advised by [Norbert L&uuml;tkenhaus](https://uwaterloo.ca/physics-astronomy/people-profiles/norbert-lutkenhaus). 

I also work part-time as a Research Analyst at [evolutionQ](https://www.evolutionq.com).

Previously, I got my BS(Research) degree from the [Indian Institute of Science](https://iisc.ac.in/), Bengaluru in 2020. During my undergraduate degree, I worked with [Manas Kulkarni](https://www.icts.res.in/people/manas-kulkarni) and [Abhishek Dhar](https://www.icts.res.in/people/abhishek-dhar) at [ICTS-TIFR](https://www.icts.res.in).

# Research Interests
I am broadly interest in both the theoretical and practical aspects of quantum information and computation, with a particular focus on Quantum Key Distribution (QKD). During my graduate studies, my work has primarily centered around the security analysis of practical QKD protocols. I remain deeply interested in everything related to QKD.

In addition, I continue to work on accurate desciptions of open quantum systems. Specifically, I am interested in examining the validity of various quantum master equations, independent of specific system-bath setups. 

Recently, I have begun to explore classical cryptography and have developed a growing interest in quantitative finance.
