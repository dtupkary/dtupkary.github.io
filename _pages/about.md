I am Devashish, currently a graduate student in Physics at the [Institute for Quantum Computing](https://uwaterloo.ca/institute-for-quantum-computing/), Canada, where I am a Mike and Ophelia Laziridis Fellow. At IQC, I am primarily working on security proofs of Quantum Key Distribution, advised by [Norbert L&uuml;tkenhaus](https://uwaterloo.ca/physics-astronomy/people-profiles/norbert-lutkenhaus). I am also broadly interested in various aspects quantum information theory. 

Previously, I got my BS(Research) degree from the [Indian Institute of Science](https://iisc.ac.in/), Bengaluru in 2020. During my undergraduate degree, I worked with [Manas Kulkarni](https://www.icts.res.in/people/manas-kulkarni) and [Abhishek Dhar](https://www.icts.res.in/people/abhishek-dhar) at [ICTS-TIFR](https://www.icts.res.in), on open quantum systems.
